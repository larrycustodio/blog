Pretty stoked to get started with this blog!

My primary motivator to keep this up is to: have an accessible platform to continuously build my skills in programming, share my thoughts on picking up cool new concepts (both tech- and non-tech related), and have a healthy medium for building up on my lack of skills in expressive writing.

I spend a good chunk of my time at work encountering new ideas and concepts, and so it helps a ton to write things down to have a reliable reference. Plus, I am a forgetful man, so I've built up many years of experience in effective notetaking; great notes proves to be useful in many situations, mostly whenever I have to reapply similar ideas in other aspects of my job, or whenever someone asks me a question that I've spent hours googling/digging through stack overflow threads.

To get acclimated with the habit of writing out my thoughts through blogging, I'll start off writing about topics that I'm currently reading up on: review materials on CS fundamentals! In other words, some data structures, and high-level exercises on algorithms. I'm fairly confident with my ability to doodle, and so a good chunk of my posts *may* contain some fun drawings and sketches to supplement my writing. 

<strong>A bit about myself</strong>: I am a software engineer who enjoys hacking up tools to make my internet browsing experience more convenient, keeping up with what's new and trendy on the web news, and overanalyzing my side hobbies (like cooking, running, photo editing, and watching/reading up on sports).
