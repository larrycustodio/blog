Pretty stoked to get started with this blog!

My primary motivator to keep this up is to: have an accessible platform to continuously build my skills in programming, share my thoughts on picking up cool new concepts (both tech- and non-tech related), and have a healthy medium for building up on my lack of skills in expressive writing.

Since I spend a good chunk of my time at work encountering new ideas and concepts, it helps a ton to write things down and have a reliable reference for future use. I am a forgetful man, and so it helps to have the habit of writing things down as a means of reminding myself. Plus, having great notes proves to be useful whenever I have to reapply similar ideas in other aspects of the job.

To get acclimated with the habit of writing out my thoughts through blogging, I'll be starting off with posts on what I'm currently working on: reviewing fundamentals in data structures, and some high-level exercises on algorithms. I'm fairly confident with my ability to doodle, and so a good chunk of my posts *may* contain some fun drawings and sketches to supplement my writing. 

<strong>A bit about myself</strong>: I am a software engineer who enjoys hacking up tools to make my internet browsing experience more convenient, keeping up with what's new and trendy on the web news, and overanalyzing my side hobbies (like cooking, running, photo editing, and watching/reading up on sports).
